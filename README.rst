Project Pyflo
=============

Pyflo is an open-source library written in Python for performing
hydraulic and hydrology stormwater analysis. Capabilities include
network hydraulic grade analysis and time/iteration based storage and flood
routing simulations. SCS Unit Hydrograph and Rational Method are included
for basin computations. Most of the calculations and procedures are
derived from available existing publications and resources. There are
some GUI programs available that have similar capabilities. The intent is
that many will build from and contribute to the project, making it much
more powerful than a single person ever could.

To install the easy way, using `pip`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyflo
